# 🧠 Smart Pointers in Rust

This module explores Rust's smart pointers and ownership patterns. It includes hands-on examples and tests for:

## ✅ Topics Covered
- `Box<T>` for heap allocation
- `Rc<T>` for shared ownership
- `RefCell<T>` for interior mutability
- Building a singly linked list with `Box`
- Refactoring with `Rc` and `RefCell`

| File              | Description                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `box_list.rs`     | Linked list using `Box<T>`                  |
| `rc_example.rs`   | Shared ownership with `Rc<T>`               |
| `refcell_demo.rs` | Mutable borrow checks with `RefCell<T>`     |

## 🧪 How to Run
```bash
cargo run -p smart_pointers
cargo test -p smart_pointers
